# Typewriter Auto-scroll VSCode Extension

## Introduction

Are you a VIM user? Frustrated with scrolling when you start getting close to the bottom of your page? Don't want to use ```page-up``` or ```page-down```?

Like a typewriter, the focused line will remain in the middle of your screen. Keeping your hands on the keyboard and not on the mouse.

Work faster and more elegantly.

## Extension Setting

* `typewriterAutoScroll.enable`: enable/disable this extension
