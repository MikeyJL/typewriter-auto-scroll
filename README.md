# Typewriter Auto-scroll VSCode Extension

Are you a VIM user? Frustrated with scrolling when you start getting close to the bottom of your page? Don't want to use ```page-up``` or ```page-down```?

Like a typewriter, the focused line will remain in the middle of your screen. Keeping your hands on the keyboard and not on the mouse.

Work faster and more elegantly.

## Extension Setting

* `toggleTypewriter`: enable/disable this extension.
* `changeTypewriterOffset`: offsets the centered/focused line by the specified amount.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0 Initial release

- Just a basic function at the moment. There are a few things on the road-map but don't expect any new updates yet.

### 1.1.0 Bug fix

- Made typewriter-autoscroll ignore selection changes from mouse input to improve UX.

### 1.1.1 Added custom offset command

- You can now change the offset of the focused line by any amount. E.g., an offset of -10 will place your focus 10 lines below the center of your editor screen.
